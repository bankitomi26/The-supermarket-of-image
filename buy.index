    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">The question that arises for the field of what I have suggested 
calling iconomics – the general economy of images that attempts to capture the laws of their circulation and exchange – is not only the future of iconic pathways and vehicles in the 
digital age, but also their history, how they are descended from the road networks that criss-crossed the visible in the past. </p>
    <p class="text_column"> For, on the one hand, the current infrastructures of the visible often form part of an unsuspected continuity with the communication networks that preceded them, and on the other hand, they introduce speed diferentials into the visible, contrasts between high-speed and extremely slow image propagation that are so pronounced that they seem simultaneously to be part of breathtakingly disjointed existence patterns. </p>
    <p class="text_column">What is it that the gaze doesn’t see as it moves around between 
images or in images – just as images move around between themselves – as it comes and goes, oscillating, jerking about, scanning, punctuating, constantly assessing and attentive to 
the slightest diference? What can it not see? What will always remain in the shadows? </p>

      <p>The significance of a pigment can only be understood in relation to colour absorption. The word 'colour', in the strict sense of the term, .cannot describe a material substance, for colour is only the luminous sensation resulting from the selective absorption by the substance of certain of the light waves which constitute white light. 'What the eye sees as colour is the remaining, unabsorbed light.  </p>

      <p>The colourless light of the sun is derived from a mass of rays of varying wavelength which can be analysed by refraction through a prism to form a spectrum of colour within which can be distinguished six main hues, namely, violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. A substance which absorbs all the rays of the sun is said to be black whereas one which reflects all of them is white; so, in a strictly physical sense, black and white cannot be described as colours. When light is reflected almost but not quite completely the effect of greyness results. In this case there has only been a small absorption of light. </p>
